On untrusted websites, it's recommended to use a separate user for launching the browsers in combination with the seccomp profile. Inside the container or if you are using the Docker image as a base image you have to use adduser for it.

docker run -it --rm --ipc=host --user pwuser --security-opt seccomp=seccomp_profile.json mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.33.0-jammy /bin/bash

}

Using --ipc=host is recommended when using Chrome (Docker docs). Chrome can run out of memory without this flag.
